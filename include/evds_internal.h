/// @struct EVDS_VARIABLE
/// @brief Single variable of an object, or an entry/field in a data structure.
///
/// Variables are used for storing simulation information and objects internal (hidden) state,
/// for example fuel tank dimensions and current amount of fuel in the tank.
///
/// Variables can only be created or removed before the object is initialized. Example:
/// ~~~{.c}
///		EVDS_OBJECT* object;
///		EVDS_VARIABLE* variable;
///		EVDS_Object_Create(system,parent,&object);
///		EVDS_Object_AddVariable(object,"center_of_mass",EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_VECTOR,&variable);
///		EVDS_Object_AddRealVariable(object,"mass",5000.0,&variable);
/// ~~~
///
/// If variable already exists when adding, the function simply returns that variable (and does not change
/// its value or create a new one), otherwise creates the variable with the default value.
///
/// @note If variable already exists but has a mismatching variable type, the function for adding variable
///       will fail.
///
/// All work with variables (before the object is initialized) must be done from the initializing thread.
/// If the initalizing thread must be changed in runtime (for example to pass an uninitialized object
/// to another thread) the EVDS_Object_TransferInitialization() call can be used.
///
/// @note Only thread that is initializing/creating the object may change lists of variables,
///       since the raw variable data is not reference counted or tracked in any way. 
///       Any threads which would retrive pointer to variable in other thread may run into
///       crash if variable data is removed.
///
/// A variable may have be of one of the following types:
/// Type								| Description
/// ------------------------------------|--------------------------------------
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_FLOAT			| Floating point value
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_STRING		| Null-terminated string
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_VECTOR		| Vector
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_QUATERNION	| Quaternion
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_NESTED		| Data structure (contains a list of nested variables, list of attributes)
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_DATA_PTR		| Stores pointer to custom data (some C structure)
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_FUNCTION_PTR	| Stores a function/callback pointer. Function signature depends on variable name
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_FUNCTION		| Multi-dimensional pre-defined function
///
/// Raw data structure pointers
/// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// It is possible to use variable types @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_FUNCTION_PTR and @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_DATA_PTR
/// for storing pointers to arbitrary binary data. These variables cannot be saved or loaded and must only
/// be used in runtime.
///
/// @note Only the pointer is stored, EVDS will not perform any memory management related operations on the pointer.
///
/// @note Custom raw data structures are not thread safe - thread safety must be provided by the user.
///
/// Interpolated functions
/// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @todo Missing documentation
///
/// Nested variables
/// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @c EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_NESTED type is stored for using arbitrary data structures. It may contain other 
/// nested variables or attributes inside it.
///
/// If the data structure represents some higher level data structure, the solve can create
/// a new variable of EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_DATA_PTR type during initialization to store a low-level data
/// structure that will represent data from EVDS_VARIABLE_TYPE_NESTED.
///
/// Here's an example of a nested data structure (geometry information for the tessellator):
/// ~~~{.xml}
///	<parameter name="geometry.cross_sections">
///		<section type="ellipse" add_offset="1" rx="1.9" offset="0.5" />
///		<section type="ellipse" add_offset="1" rx="2" />
///		<section type="ellipse" offset="10.4" add_offset="1" rx="2" />
///		<section type="ellipse" offset="0.4" add_offset="1" rx="1.6" />
///		<section type="ellipse" add_offset="1" rx="1.5" />
///		<section type="ellipse" offset="-0.3" add_offset="1" rx="1.5" />
///	</parameter>
/// ~~~
///
/// Here's an example of a more complicated material entry which contains varied types of
/// custom data:
/// ~~~{.xml}
///	<entry name="Gravimol" class="thermal_soak_shielding">
///	<information>

/// @ingroup EVDS_OBJECT
/// @struct EVDS_OBJECT
/// @brief Single object with a coordinate system.
///
/// EVDS objects can be used to define:
///  - Propagators (coordinate systems in which children states are propagated)
///  - Vessels/moving objects
///  - Planets and planet-like bodies
///  - Objects which create forces (engines, wings)
///  - Special objects which may create additional objects during initialization
///
/// The objects behavior depends on its parent. Some objects are only meaningful
/// when their parent is some specific object type (for example engine nozzles will
/// only affect behavior of the engine object, and do not have any behavior otherwise).
///
/// @note The object hierarchy as saved to file may not match up with what the simulation
///       will use for calculations - additional objects may be added, some may be removed.
///
/// From EVDS point of view the objects can be in three states:
///  - Created (after object was just created) - this allows setting up the objects internal
///    variables.
///  - Initializing (while object is being initialized by solvers initializer)
///  - Active/initialized - when object becomes part of the physical world.
///
/// Every EVDS object may have some basic dynamic data defined:
///  - Mass
///  - Moments of inertia tensor
///  - Center of mass position (without accounting for children objects)
///  - Cross-sections that define objects geometry
///
/// This information is optional and will only be used for representing the physical shape
/// and properties of the object. Only some specific solvers (for example rigid body) will
/// use this information for actual physics.
///
/// Each object contains a list of variables (see EVDS_VARIABLE). These variables represent
/// objects internal (hidden) state and various object parameters.
///
/// @note Only thread that is initializing/creating the object may change lists of variables,
///       since the raw variable data is not reference counted or tracked in any way. 
///       Any threads which would retrive pointer to variable in other thread may run into
///       crash if variable data is removed.
///
/// Objects are defined by their type and name. Two objects may not have the same name within
/// the same parent while they are being initialized.
/// Two objects may share names globally, but only one of them will be returned when queried.
///
/// @note If two names do in fact have same names under one parent, they will be renamed during initialization.
///
/// Each object additionally has a numerical identifier that's unique globally. It is used for
/// identifying objects in a shorter way and also for networking facilities. It can be set by user
/// before the object is initialized.
///
/// @note If initialized object has a unique identifier that's already used, it will be given a new
///       unique identifier.
///
/// See EVDS_Object_SetName(), EVDS_Object_SetType(), EVDS_Object_SetUID() for more information
/// about object names, types, unique identifiers.
///
/// Object may contain a pointer to user data (any data structure user wishes to attach to the object),
/// and a pointer to solver data (any data structure that was assigned to the object by the solver).
/// API is same for both pointers, but the solver data must be used exclusively by the objects solver:
/// ~~~{.c}
///		void* userdata = malloc(128);
///		EVDS_Object_SetUserdata(object,userdata);
/// ~~~
/// ~~~{.c}
///		void* userdata;
///		EVDS_Object_GetUserdata(object,&userdata);
///		free(userdata);
/// ~~~
///
/// EVDS contains fast partially-lockless multithreading support for the objects. The following limits apply:
///  - Objects can be created and destroyed in any threads at any time
///  - Application must stop using destroyed objects within moments after they have been destroyed.
///  - If application has to keep object data around for longer, then objects must be reference counted
///    explicitly by the application using EVDS_Object_Store() and EVDS_Object_Release().
///  - A single object must not be deleted from more than one thread at once (this will cause race condition
///    and the EVDS system will enter an interdeterminate state)
///  - Object data will be retained in memory until no more references to it exist,
///     and physically removed after EVDS_System_CleanupObjects() is called
///  - Objects must be initialized after loading. Initialization and all operations which
///     alter list of variables must be done only within the initializing thread (operations
///     with list of variables are not thread-safe).
